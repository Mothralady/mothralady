### Hi, I'm Juliya

[![Moon.svg](https://moon-svg.minung.dev/moon.svg?theme=ray&rotate=0)](https://juliya.dev)

I'm in my early 30's and live in Austin, Texas. 

I am a self-taught web developer. My own passions motivate me. 

These days I am creating a digital agency called Redheads, paid dev work will fund pro bono work for unsigned, local musicians.

I can use any language, any framework, any engine, etc. given enough time. I can teach myself anything. I am getting into Game Jams for this reason, challenging myself to use obscure tools to create. Great way to learn. 

I don't promise to have the most impressive Github account, my commits will be messy and probably full of curse words. I don't like Corporate bullshit, or appealing to some future overlord to hire me letting that infect everything I do. This is me in all my glory. 

Thanks for reading :)
