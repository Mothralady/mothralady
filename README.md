### Hi, I'm Juliya

I'm in my early 30's and live in Austin, Texas. 

I am a self-taught web developer. That means I basically had no idea what to do with my life and decided to *learn how to code*, a very popular suggestion back then. I could not afford to go to college but I'm glad I didn't or else I wouldn't be completely debt-free like I am today. It was not easy and it took a long time to establish myself, but I became successfully self-employed developing websites for small businesses in my area at 21 years old and I owe that to myself, and no one else. I am not going to get into everything I ever did as a developer, I find that exhausting. I am not looking for anyone to hire me so I feel no need to try to impress whoever decides to read this, sorry. If you really want to know try having a conversation with me first. 

I stopped freelancing right before Covid happened and decided it was the perfect time to take several years off and focus on myself but now I am back. What else needs to be said?

Oh well, maybe the fact I started a Video Game Studio here in Austin with my friend Janine. But again, we aren't motivated by profit, clout, or any of the bullshit. We are building our passion projects with very little to no risk to us. We have nothing to lose, so we cannot fail. 

Thanks for reading :)
