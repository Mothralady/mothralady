### Hi, I'm Juliya

I'm in my early 30's and live in Austin, Texas. 

I am a self-taught web developer. My own passions motivate me. I am not looking to be hired, I am not looking for funding. I create just because I CAN.

I stopped freelancing right before Covid happened and decided it was the perfect time to take several years off and focus on myself but now I am back. What else needs to be said?

These days I am getting into Game Development. 

I can use any language, any framework, any engine, etc. given enough time. I can teach myself anything. I am getting into Game Jams for this reason, challenging myself to use obscure tools to create. Great way to learn. 

I don't promise to have the most impressive Github account, my commits will be messy and probably full of curse words. I don't like Corporate bullshit, or appealing to some future overlord to hire me letting that infect everything I do. And if I ever have my own successful studio, we will make it a point to prioritize the well-being of our devs over the interests of stakeholders. 

Thanks for reading :)
